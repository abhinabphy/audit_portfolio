# 🔍 Smart Contract Audit Findings

This repo is a collection of smart contract vulnerabilities I’ve discovered during manual reviews and protocol deep-dives. 

Each folder contains writeups, PoCs, or notes related to a specific protocol.

🧪 Tools I use: Foundry, Slither, Etherscan, decompilers, and manual analysis.

All findings are either responsibly disclosed or publicly available.  
Aimed to help others learn from real bugs in complex DeFi systems.
