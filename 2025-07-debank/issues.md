### Summary
By passing a malicious adapter through Router.swap(), a compromised admin can exploit the delegatecall in Executor to overwrite critical storage—specifically the owner slot. This results in full control over adapter configuration and swap flow, allowing the attacker to blacklist all adapters, freeze swaps, and cause a complete service-level denial-of-service of the protocol.
### Root Cause
The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the insecure use of delegatecall within the Executor contract. The system is designed to route swaps through external adapter contracts using delegatecall in [Executor.sol#L76-L81](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-07-debank/blob/71400519400e462f92f4b7104a73fa1d8f599321/swap-router-v1/src/executor/Executor.sol#L76-L81) , which runs the adapter’s logic within the storage context of the Executor itself.
This approach exposes critical internal storage — such as the owner variable stored at slot 0 (due to inheritance from OpenZeppelin’s Ownable) — to manipulation. If an attacker can deploy a malicious adapter and convince an admin to whitelist it, they can overwrite storage via crafted delegatecall payloads during a normal swap. This results in full ownership takeover, the ability to modify or wipe out the adapter whitelist, and ultimately a denial-of-service attack that halts all protocol swaps. The core issue is the absence of sandboxing or memory isolation between trusted core logic and externally registered adapter code.
### External Pre-conditions
1.An admin needs to call `updateAdaptor()` to set `whiteListAdapter[maliciousAdapter]` to be true(malicious or accidental behaviour)
### Attack Path
1. **Attacker** deploys a **malicious adapter** contract with custom logic to overwrite storage slot `0` (e.g., to set themselves /random address as `Executor.owner`),disable *re-entrancy* status or overwrite *whitelisted* mapping.
2. **Admin** (accidentally or maliciously) calls `Router.updateAdaptor()` to whitelist the attacker's adapter.
→ *This is required because only whitelisted adapters are allowed to be executed.*
3. **Attacker** calls `Router.swap()` and includes their **malicious adapter** in the swap path.
→ *The input uses the adapter in a valid `MultiPath` and `SinglePath` structure.*
4. **Router** forwards the call to `Executor.executeMegaSwap()` with the attacker's adapter included in the path.
5. **Executor** performs a `delegatecall` into the attacker’s adapter at , executing its logic **within Executor's storage context**.
6. **Malicious adapter logic** overwrites storage slot `0`, setting `Executor.owner` to the attacker’s address.
7. **Attacker** now owns the `Executor`, and calls `updateAdaptor()` to remove all valid adapters or add more malicious ones(Though anyways `executeMegaSwap` is broken now being owned by `router` which is not an owner anymore after the attack !! So this step is not necessary).
8. **Swaps begin to fail** as no valid adapter paths remain, effectively causing a **protocol-wide denial-of-service (DoS)**.
### Impact
The protocol suffers a complete halt of all swap operations.
The attacker gains full control over the Executor contract and can block swaps, remove adapters, or add backdoors.
This results in a protocol-wide denial-of-service (DoS) for all users, who can no longer execute swaps.

### Mitigation
1.Remove `delegatecall`, use `call` instead
